This application may not achieve what you are ultimately after. I have received the following email regarding modifying photos in Google Photos folder in Google Drive:

Thank you for contacting the Google Drive Support Team!

To recap, we chatted earlier about photos within your Google Drive. 

Based on what we have discussed, you can copy, move, and edit photos in Google Drive, but those changes will not be reflected in Google Photos.
